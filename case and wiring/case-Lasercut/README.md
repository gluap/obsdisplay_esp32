# Lasercut case

## Parts to cut
Cut the parts from [lasercut_parts.svg](lasercut_parts.svg) out of 4mm plywood.

If you want to be fancy, you can make the back wall (the part held in place with 4 screws) out of 4mm acrylic instead.

Sensibly select the vectors you want to cut/burn in (burn in the logo / all other vectors).
